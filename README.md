Understanding and leveraging machine-readable formats is fundamental to effective data wrangling. By utilizing these formats, data professionals can streamline their workflows and extract meaningful insights from diverse datasets.
Understanding and leveraging machine-readable formats is fundamental to effective data wrangling. By utilizing these formats, data professionals can streamline their workflows and Documentation Considerations:**
When documenting data wrangling processes, it's important to specify the machine-readable formats used for input data, intermediate processing steps, and output results. This ensures clarity and reproducibility for other users and collaborators.
Common Machine-Readable Formats:**
1. **CSV (Comma-Separated Values):** A plain text format where each line represents a row of data, with values separated by commas. CSV is widely supported and easy to work with in various programming languages and tools.
   
2. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight data interchange format that is human-readable and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used for transmitting data between a server and a web application.

3. **XML (eXtensible Markup Language):** A markup language that encodes documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML is commonly used for representing structured data and is often seen in web services and configuration files.

4. **Parquet:** A columnar storage file format optimized for storing and processing large datasets. Parquet is highly efficient for analytics and data processing tasks, especially in big data environments.
